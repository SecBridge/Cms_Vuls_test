```

### Vulnerability description

There is a SQL injection vulnerability in SEMCMS v4.8. The vulnerability stems from the lack of verification of the external input SQL statement in the parameter AID of SEMCMS_Function.php. An attacker can use this vulnerability to execute illegal SQL commands to obtain sensitive data in the database.

### Vulnerability analysis

The vulnerability exists on line 316 of SEMCMS_Function.php:

```
$db_conn->query("update sc_products set products_zt='$indext' where ID in ($area_arr)");
```

$area_arr gets value at line 17 of SEMCMS_Function.php:

```
if (isset($_POST["AID"])){$area_arr = $_POST["AID"];$area_arr = implode(",",$area_arr);}else{$area_arr="";}
```

It can be found that the AID value passed in by the front end has not been verified by the verify_str() function. The verify_str() function is mainly used to prevent SQL injection. Its code is as follows:
